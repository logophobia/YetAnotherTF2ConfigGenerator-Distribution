Features
--------

  - Crosshair (color, type, scale)
  - Sensitivity
  - Showing/Hiding the weapon model
  - Dingaling (volume, max/min pitch)
  - Interp-ratio
  - Tweakable viewmodel hiding behaviour. After switching weapons, hide the viewmodel after strafing/shooting or immediately

* Option to hide the tracers, flames or the medic healbeam
* Option to show a netgraph with the scoreboard to identify network issues
* Option to turn gibs/ragdolls/sprays on/off

* Crouchjump bind, with the option to exclude it for certain classes (default excluded for demoman/soldier)
* Team-only voice bind
* Bind for quick-switching weapon loadouts
* Bind for toggling to a forward spawn (if you want to retain uber or types of charge, switch weapons with the quickswitch bind instead)
* Binds for switching primary/secondary, switching current/melee, previous weapon, next inventory and previous inventory weapon
* Bind for suicide, reloading the hud and fixing graphical glitches
* Binds for all the voice commands
* Medic: Medic radar bind, fake uber bind, option to communicate ubers automatically through chat

* Engineer: Quickbuild binds
* Sniper: option to disable the crosshair when zooming in, option to change the zoomed in sensitivity, option to sound a bell when the sniper rifle is charged
* Zoom in bind (changes fov+sensitivity to zoom in)
* P-Rec settings

Installation
-------------

* Download the program [here](https://github.com/downloads/logophobia/YetAnotherTF2ConfigGenerator/YATF2ConfigGenerator-0.10.zip)
* Make sure you have a new version of the java runtime (1.6 or higher would probably work) installed, [this is a version without toolbar crap](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre7-downloads-1637588.html)
* Unzip the program and double click on the jar file to start
* Set everything up the way you want to, make sure you copy most of your essential settings in tf2, like your mouse sensitivity (very annoying when that gets changed)
* Select your steam directory and username and save the configuration files to tf2
* Save the settings for further editing if you might want to change some small things later
* Use the backup button to make a backup if you have any scripts you might like to preserve

Uninstallation
---------------

* Delete all the .cfg files inside the tf/cfg directory
* Run tf2 once with the -autoconfig flag (inside the launch options) to reset tf2 to default
* Place any backed-up cfg files back

FAQ
----

I am having issues, it crashes. How can I fix this?

Try the following things:
* Make sure you unzip your program before running it, otherwise it won't be able to find any of the files it needs
* Upgrade java to its latest version (from the link provided in the installation instructions), earlier java version don't work very well with this program
* Try to generate the scripts locally, and copying them manually the the tf/cfg directory in the team fortress installation directory1
* Post an explanation + screenshot (if applicable) with the crash/issue on my github page: github.com/logophobia/YetAnotherTF2ConfigGenerator or add me at steamcommunity.com/id/logophobia

What is viewmodel switch mode?

It indicates when the viewmodel is turned off if that is set for the weapon slot:
* Immediately after switching weapons
* After firing a weapon
* After switching strafe directions
* After either firing or strafing

I have a feature request, where can I post it?

Post any suggestions on the github page

What does medic radar do precisely?

It toggles medic autocall to 150%, so each of your teammates has a medic symbol above their heads, which you can see through walls. As soon as you let go of the button, it will go back to its original autocall level

How can I customize this even more?

You could try editing the original templates, in the template directory. First, delete the cache directory. Then edit the templates, the language used is ssp: http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/ssp-reference.html. After that, the program will use your editted version of the templates. 

What other ways to customize tf2 are there?

You can install custom huds, skins, hitsounds or customize/make your own scripts

My ambassador crosshair disappeared, how can I fix this?

For some reason, the crosshair after shooting is about half the default size. Increasing the size of the spy primary crosshair should fix this.

Changing settings inside tf2 doesn't work, it just gets changed back. How can I change my settings?

The scripts that were installed now regulate most of your settings inside tf2. Change stuff through the program, and then reinstall the scripts, or uninstall the scripts and be free to change things inside tf2 again.

Todo (1.0-RC)
-----

* create license
* show all crosshairs, even default ones based on class
* Prehaps drop P-Rec support in the future (due to disappearance plugin online)
* Make dialogs copyable
* Other requests?

Testing todo (1.0-RC)
-----

* Create a "base" set of profiles, options:
  * "Exactly" the same as normal tf2
  * Profile for nice default crosshair settings
  * WASD/ESDF/RDFG layouts, competative oriented
  * Spy/Medic/Engineer oriented binds
* Tutorial video
* Test a lot more
  

Known Bugs
-----------

* When building as an engineer, if you start building, then switch weapons before putting the building down, the crosshairs will get out of sync, switch weapons once to fix
